description: "Opinionated house rules for React, Next.js, and Tailwind code in a feature-based layout, covering what the Vercel skills leave out: colocation and extraction, the Tailwind cva ladder, comments and JSDoc, file order, magic literals and `as const` unions, conditional rendering, and per-request state. Use when writing or reviewing frontend components, hooks, feature folders, className props, comments, file layout, literals, conditional branches, or stores and providers."

# Frontend Standards

House rules that complement the Vercel skills. Each rule names the Vercel rule IDs it touches, with a one-line meaning, so it reads without them installed.

Precedence, in order:

1. The repository's own standards (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and whatever they point at). These rules fill the room the repository leaves. On a conflict with the repository or with a Vercel rule, follow the higher item and say the conflict exists.
2. Vercel `react-best-practices` for measured performance, `composition-patterns` for component APIs, the `nextjs` skill for framework mechanics, the `shadcn` skill for component-library conventions. Read the rule the task touches, not the whole skill.
3. These rules for default code shape.

## Rules

| Rule | One line |
|---|---|
| [colocation](rules/colocation.md) | Narrowest scope that matches ownership today. Extract on a named problem, share on shared ownership. |
| [tailwind](rules/tailwind.md) | Classes stay on the element. Repetition is evidence, not a command. `cn` → map → `cva` by count. |
| [comments](rules/comments.md) | Code says the what and the how first. A comment is the residue: why, why-not, warning, contract, coupling, reference. |
| [file-order](rules/file-order.md) | Newspaper order: imports, shared constants and types, main export, sub-components, helpers. A part's own constant sits above it. `function` declarations keep it top-down. |
| [magic-literals](rules/magic-literals.md) | A literal stays inline when its meaning is on the line. It takes a name when a reader must decode it or a second reader appears. `as const` unions, no `enum`. |
| [conditional-render](rules/conditional-render.md) | First row that holds the branch: early return → ternary → map → sub-component → variable before JSX → IIFE last. A ternary never nests. |
| [state](rules/state.md) | Tool choice and store shape are the repository's. A store holding request data is created per request, inside its provider. |
